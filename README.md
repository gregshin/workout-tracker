# workout-tracker
Simple workout tracker prototype to practice inheritance and polymorphism.

## Description
This is a simple CLI program to uses exercise tracking to demonstrate class iheritance and polymorphism in object oriented programming. Each class is separated into its own set of files consisting of header file and class file. 

## Hierarchy
Each type of exercise is respresented as its own class, which specific workouts inheriting from broader class categories.

### Class Inheritance Tree
